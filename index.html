            <p>Sagebrush Boardworks is an exploration of the limits of creativity in boardsports.
                 Driven by a strong DIY ethos and the opportunity for self expression we aim to turn ideas into tangible and rideable art.
                  All board sports come from the surf and we are no different. Founded by a life long surfer and self shaper who moved to inland
                   Oregon, all of our boards are surf inspired to some extent or made for feeling the flow on lakes and rivers. Come join us on our journey into the glide.
